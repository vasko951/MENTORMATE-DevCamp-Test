# MENTORMATE-DevCamp-Test
Hello!
Thank you Mentormate for the oportunity that you give to people.

This is my solution to the first test("Green vs. Red") given by MENTORMATE
for Rookie to Rockstar Full-Stack Intern.

I know that it was expected to use classes but I used functions due to me not being able
to use classes efficiently as of yet, but if I progress to the next level I promise that
I would have improved sufficiently and use them.

Regardless of the outcome of the evaluation of my solution I want to thank you again for this
amazing opportunity that you have presented to me and many others like me.

Best Regards
Vasil Damyanov
